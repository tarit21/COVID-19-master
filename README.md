### Automated Detection of COVID-19 Cases Using Deep Neural Networks with X-Ray Images

In this study, a deep learning model is proposed for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19. The proposed model is developed to provide accurate diagnostics for binary classification (COVID vs. No-Findings) and multi-class classification (COVID vs. No-Findings vs. Pneumonia). Our model produced an average classification accuracy of 98.08% for binary classes and 87.02% for multi-class cases.
